            The Race Ventura application can be used by race organizations to setup their event. A race consists of one or multiple stages and each stage has several Control Points (CP) that teams need to navigate to in order to get points. The application is used
            to keep track of the stages, CP’s and teams in an event and calculates the result of the race. The organization can keep track of the CP’s teams visit by using the website or teams can register the CP’s them self by using the mobile app that
            can be downloaded from the mobile app store.

        <p class="lead">
            The mobile app automates the registration of CP’s by using a phone’s camera to scan QR-codes and checking the location by using its GPS location. This way a CP can only be registered when a team scans the QR-code on the right location. To prevent cheating
            the app user needs to register his device to a team by also scanning a QR-code. Only device registered to a team can register CP’s for that team. All the QR-codes are generated by the web application and can be distributed to the teams by
            the event organization.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Final result</h2>
        <p class="lead">
            The results are calculated in the following way. First the number of stages a team finished count, if multiple teams have the same number of finished stages the total value of CP’s registered by a team is used to make the difference. If the total value
            is also the same, then the race duration is used to set teams apart. The value of CP’s and the number of CP’s needed to finish a stage can be set in the web application by the organization. It is also possible to configure a penalty for teams
            that finish the race after the end time of the race. This penalty will be subtracted from the total value of CP’s registered by a team.

        <p class="lead">
            The application support different kinds of CP’s. There is the normal CP where teams only need to visit the CP. There are question CP’s where teams need to answer a question correctly to register the CP. And there are special task CP’s where the team needs
            to preform a task before they can register the CP (a member of the organization needs to be present to check if the teams do the task). The special tasks can be counted as a stage to encourage teams to finish the special tasks.
